# My Work
## Budget Pros
##### Capstone
Paired Program - BudgetPros is a site that aids users in becoming more conscious of their spending, and helps users organize their transactions. Our site can make users more mindful of their spending by having users update their profile with each transaction and categorize them to see what they spend on non-essential expenses. Utilizing Spring Security ,JPA Repositories, the use of Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, CSS and JavaScript our views are dynamic, secure and user-friendly
